The purpose of repo created in the warmup is to store the projects for the
class Stats 507. 

The purpose of the previous script, i.e. PS 2 Problem 3, I use will use
Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES. For the part (a) and 
part (b), I clean the data both for demographical data and dentition data.
For the part (c), I report the number of cases of the two datasets in (a)
and (b). The local path for the file is "junqianliu/Desktop/STATS 507/git/".
